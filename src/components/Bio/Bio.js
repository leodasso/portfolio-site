          <p>Hi, I'm Leo! In 2002, my middle school friend introduced
          me to the programming language on the TI-86 calculator. Since then, I've been fascinated by the
          world of software and computing.</p>
          <p>
           I studied illustration in college with the ambition of
          getting into game development, although I maintained my personal practice of programming throughout.
          I learned so much in my time developing indie games, and I'm grateful that I could work with the
          people I did who taught me so much. My interest now lies in web development, and bringing micro-joys
          into peoples' experiences on the web.
          </p>
